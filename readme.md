### UI Automation Utilities - WinUIDriver

I'm just extracting some utility code I found useful when testing a webform application.   It is a simple wrapper over Microsoft's UIAutomation library.


## UIInspect.exe

The UIAutamation code provides functionality for element discovery, the second is action.  For element discovery, you'll want help of a tool like UIInspect.exe.  UIInspect.exe is to Windows as Firebug is to Firefox, and is documented here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd318521%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
